# gpe-cn-python
Gross-Pitaevskii equation solver using python for a rotating 2D Bose-Einstein condensate.
Can run  both real and imaginary time simulations.
Currently computes the Chemical potential, energy per atom and condensate length.

**Code is NOT fast.No parallelization for now. Will add later.**
